# Refactoring Plan: Move Styles from styles.css to TPL Files

**Objective:** Move the styles from `styles.css` into the individual HTML files located in the `tpl/` directory. The styles should be placed within `<style>` tags at the beginning of each HTML file, before the existing `<style>` tags.

**Plan:**

1.  **Extract the content of `styles.css`:** Use the `read_file` tool to get the complete CSS code from the `styles.css` file.
2.  **Iterate through the files in the `tpl/` directory:** Use the `list_files` tool to get a list of all files in the `tpl/` directory.
3.  **For each HTML file in `tpl/`:**
    *   Read the content of the HTML file using the `read_file` tool.
    *   Construct the `<style>` tag containing the CSS from `styles.css`.
    *   Insert the `<style>` tag at the beginning of the HTML file using the `insert_content` tool.
4.  **Delete the `styles.css` file:** After moving the styles to the individual files, use the `execute_command` tool to delete the `styles.css` file.
5.  **Present the result:** Once all files have been modified and `styles.css` has been deleted, use the `attempt_completion` tool to inform the user that the task is complete.
